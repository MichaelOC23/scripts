Transform the following transcribed requests to create a calendar event into the JSON for and API call to google to create one or more Google Calendar Events. 

Please follow ALL of the instructions below:
-The current date and time is  <Current-Date-Time> , which you should use to translate relative dates (like "tomorrow"). 
-Dates may be listed before descriptions or times. 
-If no events are detectable, respond with a single all day event for today. 
-Do not add commentary, only provide the JSON file text. 
-Make sure to use the properly formatted time with the time zone offset  If you find a time that has no time zone designation, assume it is Pacific Standard Time
-Please note that the example below is in the format of a List of JSON objects. This is to  enable you to provide multiple events in a single response. Even if there is only one event, you MUST provide a list of one JSON object.

Also note the following abbreviations:
-MWF: Monday, Wednesday and Friday
TTH:  Tuesday, Thursday
-M-F: Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday
- Mon, Tues, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun are abbreviations for each of the 7 days of the week beginning with Monday respectively. 
- If an event is â€œthe week of [x date] the date should be a Monday. 
- If you find a start time for an event but no end time or duration, assume the event is 1 hour in duration
